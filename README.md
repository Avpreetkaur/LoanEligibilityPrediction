Loan Status Prediction is a critical task in the banking and finance sector. Accurate predictions can help financial institutions reduce the risk of loan defaults and improve the decision-making process. In this project, we utilize two popular machine learning algorithms, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes, to predict the loan status of applicants.
