# Loan Eligibility Prediction
Loan Status Prediction is a critical task in the banking and finance sector. Accurate predictions can help financial institutions reduce the risk of loan defaults and improve the decision-making process. In this project, we utilize two popular machine learning algorithms, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes, to predict the loan status of applicants.

# Algorithms Used
- Decision Tree: A tree-based algorithm that splits the data into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each step, creating a model that predicts the target variable.

- Naive Bayes: A probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, which assumes independence between predictors. It is particularly effective for classification tasks involving categorical data.
